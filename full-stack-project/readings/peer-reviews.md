# Peer Reviews
**W9D2**

For peer reviews, you and a classmate will be evaluating each other's apps
using the same spreadsheet that the Placements team will use to grade
full-stack projects.  It is a great opportunity to get a fresh set of eyes on
your project and see how a user interacts with your site!

## Structure

You will be assigned a two different fellow students to pair with.  You will meet
with one from 1:30-2:00pm, and the other from 2:00-2:30pm.  Follow the below
framework:
  * Share your reviewer on your google doc [grading spreadsheet][peer-review-form]
  * First 15 min: review each other site's and fill out the spreadsheet
  * Second 15 min: discuss with each other the experience using each site and
  provide constructive feedback.  Provide explanations for the scores you gave.
