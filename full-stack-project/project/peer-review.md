# Peer Review

Today you will get feedback from your classmates.
You will divide into pairs and evaluate one another's apps.
You do need to do a little work ahead of time to prepare for this.

## Ahead of time

During job search portion of the curriculum, you will organize your
search materials using Google Drive.

You should have already created a Drive folder titled "Job Search -
[your name]" when getting set up for peer mock interviews. We're going
to add a new sub-folder inside that original folder to house all of your
job search materials. This is where we will provide comments and
feedback on them.

You will use this new folder for the first time at the Full Stack
Projects peer review workshop. At the workshop, you and your peers will
review one another's projects, and provide feedback.

Please prepare by working through the following instructions.

1. Create a new folder inside of your original "Job search - [your
name]" folder titled "Job Search Materials".
2. Make sure your original folder has the permissions set to "can edit"
for: career-coaches@appacademy.io   (find these options under [Folder
Name] > Share...)
3. Copy [this document][peer-review-spreadsheet] into your new "Job
Search Materials" folder. This spreadsheet lists features that we
will look for in your capstone projects, to help get the attention of
employers.   
4. Make a second copy of the doc. You will have two peer reviewers in
the workshop, and they will each need a copy. You will share these
scoresheets with them to get feedback.
