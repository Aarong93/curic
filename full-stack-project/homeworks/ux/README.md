# JotItDown

Apply the UX concepts you know to create layouts for the `index.html` and
`home.html` pages of a note-taking app. You may need to reorganize the
information, apply relevant markup, and add styling.

Don't worry about making your site dynamic: focus on just representing one
"state" for the materials presented. For example, if you decide that clicking a
list item should change the content of the main section, just show how the page
would look if that one item had already been clicked.

When you're done, compare your work against [some real examples][screenshots].

# Bonus

- Make sure your site meets [web-accessibility standards][standards].
- Implement a color scheme for your site. You scheme should have 3 colors:
background, main, and accent. You can get inspiration from [colourlovers][colors].
- Add custom [fonts][fonts]. You should have a header font and a body font.
