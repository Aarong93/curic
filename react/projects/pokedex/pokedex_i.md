# Pokedex: An Introduction to the React Router - Part 1

In this project, we'll write an React/Redux/Rails app to manage `Pokemon` and
their `Items`!

Check out the live demo [here](http://aa-pokedex.herokuapp.com/)!

## Phase 0: Rails API Setup
We've already set up a Rails backend with migrations and models in the
[skeleton][skeleton-zip].

* Download the [skeleton][skeleton-zip].
* Run `bundle install`.
* Make sure Postgres is running, then run `rake db:setup` (short for
`rake db:create db:migrate db:seed`).

Get yourself oriented.

* Take a look at the `schema`, `routes`, and `StaticPagesController`.
* Also look at the `Pokemon` and `Item` models.
* Open up the rails console (`rails c`) to see what's in the database.
* Start up the rails server (`rails s`) and visit the root url.

### API Namespace

Let's build routes for our pokémon! We want these routes to be nested under an
api namespace. Like so:

```ruby
namespace :api, defaults: {format: :json} do
  # api routes
end
```

The `defaults: {format: :json}` option tells the controller to first look for a
`.json.jbuilder` view rather than an `html.erb` view. Edit `routes.rb` to add
the following routes to our app. Your routes table should look like the
following:

```
           Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                Controller#Action
             root GET    /                          static_pages#root
api_pokemon_index GET    /api/pokemon(.:format)     api/pokemon#index {:format=>:json}
                  POST   /api/pokemon(.:format)     api/pokemon#create {:format=>:json}
      api_pokemon GET    /api/pokemon/:id(.:format) api/pokemon#show {:format=>:json}
                  PATCH  /api/pokemon/:id(.:format) api/pokemon#update {:format=>:json}
                  PUT    /api/pokemon/:id(.:format) api/pokemon#update {:format=>:json}
                  DELETE /api/pokemon/:id(.:format) api/pokemon#destroy {:format=>:json}
```

### Pokemon Controller

Build a controller to handle our pokémon `resources`.

* Generate an `Api::PokemonController`.
* Define `#index` and `#show` actions.

Remember, we want these actions to **render json responses**. To make the job
easier for our frontend, you should format your index action to serve up json
responses that look something like this:

```js
{
  1: {
    id: 1,
    name: /*...*/,
    image_url: /*...*/
  },
  2: {
    id: 2,
    name: /*...*/,
    image_url: /*...*/
  },
  //..
}
```

Here, the keys in your json response are the primary keys of the pokémon. The
values are the pokémon objects themselves. Let's use Jbuilder here!

* Create a `views/api/pokemon/index.json.jbuilder` file.
* Iterate over each pokémon.
* Use `json.set!` to explicitly set the key to the pokémon's id.
* Use `json.extract!` to grab the pokémon's `id`, `name`, and `image_url`.

Like so:

```ruby
@pokemon.each do |poke|
  json.set! poke.id do
    json.extract! poke, :id, :name, :image_url
  end
end
```

We don't need to return any more information than this for our index route!
Remember, Jbuilder allows us to *curate* our data, retrieving only the
attributes we are interested in.

* Next create a Jbuilder view for `PokemonController#show`. We want the action
to render all the information about a single pokémon, including its items.

A GET request to `localhost:3000/api/pokemon/5` should render this:

```js
{
  id: 5,
  name: "Rhydon",
  attack: 130,
  defense: 120,
  image_url: "/assets/pokemon_snaps/112.png",
  moves: [
    "horn attack",
    //...
  ],
  poke_type: "ground",
  items: [
    {
      id: 15,
      name: "Dark Vulcan",
      pokemon_id: 5,
      price: 12,
      happiness: 58,
      image_url: "/assets/pokeball.png"
    },
    //...
  ]
}
```

**Test your routes, controller actions and Jbuilder view**: Make GET requests to
(i.e. visit) `localhost:3000/api/pokemon` and
`localhost:3000/api/pokemon/:id`. Show a TA before moving on.


## Phase 1: Frontend Setup

### Node Package Manager

As with previous projects, you will need to set up a `package.json` and a
`webpack.config.js` file to configure your application to use NPM and Webpack.

* Run `npm init -f` to initialize your app's `package.json` with the default
boilerplace settings.
* `npm install --save` the following packages:
  * webpack
  * react
  * react-dom
  * react-router
  * redux
  * react-redux
  * babel-loader
  * babel-core
  * babel-preset-es2015
  * babel-preset-react
  * lodash

### Webpack

Next we need to configure Webpack to compile our `bundle.js` file.

* Create a new file called `webpack.config.js` in the root of your project.
* Copy and paste the following configuration:

  ```js
  const path = require('path');

  module.exports = {
    context: __dirname,
    entry: './frontend/pokedex.jsx',
    output: {
      path: path.join(__dirname, 'app', 'assets', 'javascripts'),
      filename: 'bundle.js'
    },
    resolve: {
      extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx']
    },
    module: {
      loaders: [
        {
          test: /\.jsx?$/,
          exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
          loader: 'babel',
          query: {
            presets: ['react', 'es2015']
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    devtool: 'source-maps'
  };
  ```

* Now that Webpack knows to create `bundle.js`, require it in our `application.js`:

  ```js
  //= require jquery_ujs
  //= require bundle
  ```

Notice that the `entry` key in `webpack.config.js` expects a file called
`./frontend/pokedex.jsx` to exist.

* Create a `frontend` folder in the root directory of your project.
* Add an entry file called `pokedex.jsx`.
* `import` both the `react` and `react-dom` packages.
* Add an event listener for `DOMContentLoaded`.
* In the callback to this listener, try rendering a simple stateless React
component to test everything we've written so far.
* Don't forget to run `webpack --watch` to generate your `bundle.js`.

Your entry file might look like the following:

```js
// frontend/pokedex.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
	const rootEl = document.getElementById('root');
	ReactDOM.render(<h1>Pokedex</h1>, rootEl);
});
```

**Test your frontend setup**: Make sure that your test component renders at the root.

### Frontend Structure
Finish your frontend setup by defining the structure of your `frontend`
folder. Nest folders called `actions`, `components`, `reducers`, `store`,
`middleware` and `util` within `frontend`.

## Phase 2: `Pokemon` Redux Cycle

### Designing the State Shape

Before we actually build anything, we need to talk about the shape of our
application state. **This is an important first step!** Don't ever skip it. For
now, we just want to be able to render all of our pokemon. This means we'll
probably want a `pokemon` slice of state that returns a collection of pokémon
objects.

<!-- TODO -->

```js
// State Shape
{
  pokemon: {
    1: { ..pokémon 1 info.. },
    2: { ..pokémon 2 info.. }
  },

  pokemonDetail: {
    id: 3,
    name: "electrode",
    ...
  },

  errors: [ "message 1", "message 2" ]
}
```

We recommend using an object to store collections of objects in an app's state.
While this may impose a few more obstacles for iterating over the collection to
render, an object will prove far superior for updating or deleting individual
pokémon in our collection (re: time complexity of objects vs array methods).
Note the current sample state looks a lot like the json response returned by the
`PokemonController#index` action.

### API Util and Action Creators

We'd like to render all of our pokemon. Let's start by setting up a way to fetch
them from the back end.

* Create an `api_util.js` file inside your `frontend/util` folder.
  * Inside this file, we'll define functions that make ajax requests fetching information from our rails api.
* Export a function called `fetchAllPokemon` that takes a success callback as
an argument.
  * The function should make an AJAX request that will make a http request to our `PokemonController#index` endpoint.
  * Run `rake routes` to determine the appropriate url for this request.

Next, define action creator to be called in the success callback we will pass `fetchAllPokemon` in our middle.

* Create a `pokemon_actions.js` file within your `frontend/actions` folder.
* Export a constant called `RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON` with the value `"RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON"`
* Export a function called `receiveAllPokemon(pokemon)` that returns an action
object.
  * This action object should have two keys: `type` of `RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON` and another for the received`pokemon` data.

Your code should look like the following:

```js
// frontend/actions/pokemon_actions.js

export const RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON = "RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON";

export const receiveAllPokemon = pokemon => ({
  type: RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON,
  pokemon
})
```

**Test that your pokemon action creator and api util work in the browser before moving on!**
* Import the action and api_util functions into your entry file.
* Assign them to the `window` to test that in the browser's console.
* You should be able to run:

  ```
  const fetchSuccess = pokemon => console.log(receiveAllPokemon(pokemon));
  fetchAllPokemon(fetchSuccess);
  ```

Now let's define and export a `requestAllPokemon()` action creator, which will
trigger the calling of our utility function in our middleware.

* Define and export the string literal constant `REQUEST_ALL_POKEMON`;
* and a `requestAllPokemon()` function. It should not receive any
arguments and should return an action object with a `type` of
`REQUEST_ALL_POKEMON`.

### `PokemonReducer`

Let's define our `PokemonReducer`. Remember that the reducer is only concerned
with describing how the state changes as a result of a dispatched action. It
takes two parameters: the previous `state` and the `action` dispatched. It
should return the new state, without mutating the previous `state`. If the
reducer doesn't care about the action being dispatched, it should return
`state`.

* Create a `frontend/reducers/pokemon_reducer.js` file.
* Import our `RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON` constant.

  ```js
  import { RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON } from '../actions/pokemon_actions';
  ```

* Define and `export default` a `PokemonReducer(state = {}, action)`.
* Add a `switch(action.type)` statement.
* Create `RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON` and default cases. Remember not to mutate `state`!

### The `RootReducer`

Before we can use our `PokemonReducer`, let's create a `RootReducer` using
Redux's `combineReducers` function. We'll use `combineReducers` to generate our
application state and assign each slice of the state to a different reducer.
This will make it easier to grow our application state.

* Create a new file: `/frontend/reducers/root_reducer.js`
* Import `combineReducers` from `redux` and our `PokemonReducer`:
* Call `combineReducer` so that our `PokemonReducer` is responsible for the
`pokemon` slice of the app state. Like so:

  ```js
  const RootReducer = combineReducers({
    pokemon: PokemonReducer
  });
  ```

* `export default RootReducer`.

### Store

Before we can test our app's reducer we need a Redux store to dispatch from.
Let's create our app's store.

* Create a `store.js` file within the `frontend/store` folder.
* Import `createStore` from the `redux` package.
* Import our `RootReducer`.

Redux's `createStore` function accepts the following parameters:
  * the reducer;
  * an optional `preloadedState`;
  * and any enhancers like as middleware.

* For now, call `createStore` and pass it our imported `RootReducer`. We will come back
to the other arguments later.
* Wrap the creation of the store in a `configureStore` function. Like so:

  ```js
  // frontend/store/store.js

  const configureStore = () => (
    createStore(
      IndexReducer
    )
  );
  ```

**NB**: This is a great pattern to continue using - instead of just exporting the
store, we are exporting a function that creates and returns a `store`. This can
be used in the future to swap out reducers, `preloadedState`, or enhancers
depending on different conditions (e.g. development vs production environments).

* In your `pokedex.jsx` entry file, import your `configureStore` function.
* Inside the `DOMContentLoaded` callback, declare a `store`.
* Call `configureStore` and assign its return value to `store`.
* For testing purposes, make `store` available on the `window` (i.e.
  `window.store = store;`).

**Test your store and reducer.** You should be able to run the following code
snippet in the browser's console:

```js
store.getState(); // should return initial app state

const fetchSuccess = pokemon => store.dispatch(receiveAllPokemon(pokemon));
fetchAllPokemon(fetchSuccess);

store.getState(); // should return the app state populated with pokemon
```

### `PokemonMiddleware`

Remember, middleware receives dispatched actions before the reducer. It can
intercept the dispatched action, trigger another dispatch, or simply pass on it
and do nothing. Our `PokemonMiddleware` will be responsible for a number of
things, including triggering api calls that eventually populate our `store` with
all of the pokémon in the datbase.

* Create a file, `middleware/pokemon_middleware.js`
* Import the following:
  * The `fetchAllPokemon` api utility function
  * The `REQUEST_ALL_POKEMON` constant
  * The `receiveAllPokemon` action creator

Recall that [Redux Middleware][middleware-docs] employs a currying strategy to
link several `Middleware` to each other and ultimately to the store. You'll need
to define 3 functions that wrap one-another like so:

  ```javascript
  const PokemonMiddleware = ({ dispatch }) => next => action => {
    // ...
  }
  ```

* Define a `PokemonMiddleware` that will `console.log` a message whenever it receives and `action` of type `REQUEST_ALL_POKEMON`. Like so:

```javascript
const PokemonMiddleware = ({ dispatch }) => next => action => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case REQUEST_ALL_POKEMON:
      console.log("gotta fetch 'em all!")
      return next(action);
    default:
      return next(action);
  }
}
```

* Export your `PokemonMiddleware`!

### `MasterMiddleware`

Similar what we did for the `RootReducer`, let's create an `MasterMiddleware`
that configures all of our middlewares.

* Create a file, `middleware/master_middleware.js`
* Import the following:
  * `applyMiddleware` from `redux`;
  * your `PokemonMiddleware`.
* Define and export your `MasterMiddleware` like so:

  ```js
  const MasterMiddleware = applyMiddleware(PokemonMiddleware);
  export default MasterMiddleware;
  ```

* Refactor your `configureStore` function to incorporate your `MasterMiddleware`.

  ```js
  // frontend/store/store.js
  import MasterMiddleware from '../middleware/master_middleware';

  const configureStore = () => (
    createStore(
      RootReducer,
      MasterMiddleware
    )
  );
  ```

[middleware-docs]: http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/Middleware.html

**Test that your app's middleware is setup properly**. Dispatch an action of
type `REQUEST_ALL_POKEMON`. Does your app print "gotta fetch 'em all!" to the
browser's console. If not, start debugging by checking your rails server
and/or putting a debugger in your middleware. Make sure this works before
moving on!

#### Connecting the Dots

Let's update our `PokemonMiddleware` to `fetchAllPokemon`, dispatching a `RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON` action if successful.

Inside of your `PokemonMiddleware` function:

* Define a callback, `receiveAllPokemonSuccess`, that dispatches a `RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON` action by calling the `receiveAllPokemon` action creator.
* Invoke `fetchAllPokemon` when a `REQUEST_ALL_POKEMON` action is dispatched.
* Pass `receiveAllPokemonSuccess` to `fetchAllPokemon` as the success callback.


  ```js
  const PokemonMiddleware = ({ dispatch }) => next => action => {
    const receiveAllPokemonSuccess = data => dispatch(receiveAllPokemon(data));

    switch(action.type) {
      case REQUEST_ALL_POKEMON:
        fetchAllPokemon(receiveAllPokemonSuccess);
        return next(action);
      //...
    }
  };
  ```

**Test your redux cycle**. In the browser console try:

```js
store.getState(); // should return initial app state
store.dispatch(requestAllPokemon());
store.getState(); // should return the app state populated with pokemon
```

You've done it! You have successfully built out two api endpoints, and
setup a Redux cycle for your pokemon! :tada:

### Selectors

We're going to add one final piece to our redux structure: selectors. Selectors
are functions that are used to "select" complex pieces of the state. Define them
in a `selectors.js` file in your app's `frontend/reducers` folder.

* Create a `frontend/reducers/selectors.js` file.
* Define and export a function, `selectAllPokemon(state)`, which accepts the
application state as an argument and exports an array of all the pokémon
objects. Use [lodash's values][lodash-values] method.

**Test your selector in the browser**. You should should be able to do the following:

```js
const initialState = store.getState();
selectAllPokemon(initialState); //=> []

store.dispatch(requestAllPokemon());

const populatedState = store.getState();
selectAllPokemon(populatedState); //=> array of pokemon objects!
```

We'll use this selector later in our pokemon components. **Show a TA that your
bug-free pokemon redux cycle before moving on!** Make sure you can explain how
the different pieces of Redux fit together (i.e. state shape, actions, reducer,
store, middleware and selector).

[lodash-values]: https://lodash.com/docs/4.16.4#values

## Phase 3: `Pokemon` React Components

### The `Root` Component

* Create a `Root` component that will be responsible for rendering all of
app's React components.
    * `Root` should be a *stateless* component (i.e. a *functional component*).
    * It will be passed the app's  Redux`store` as a prop.
    * It should wrap our all of our app's components with the `Provider` from
    `react-redux`.

Your `Root` component should look like this:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

const Root = ({ store }) => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <div>Hello, world!</div>
  </Provider>
);

export default Root;
```

**NB**: Remember that anywhere we use JSX, we *must* import React.

* Update your doc-ready callback in the entry file `pokedex.jsx` to:
  * Import your newly defined `Root` component;
  * and render it, passing is the `store` as a prop.

Like so:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
	const store = configureStore();
	const rootEl = document.getElementById('root');
	ReactDOM.render(<Root store={store}/>, rootEl);
});
```

**Test that your `Root` component is properly rendered before moving on.**

### `PokemonIndex`

Remember that there are two types of React components: presentational components
and container components. **Container components** (i.e. containers) are
concerned with subscribing to the store, reading from state, and passing down
necessary props to presentational components. Our **presentational components**
are concerned with rendering JSX and defining user interface.

#### `PokemonIndexContainer`

* Create a `frontend/components/pokemon` folder. This will house all of the
React components concerning the `pokemon` slice of state.
* With this folder, create a `pokemon_index_container.js` file.
* As with all container components, import the `connect` function from the
`react-redux` package.

The `connect` function accepts two functions as arguments: `mapStateToProps` and
`mapDispatchToProps`. Both functions are invoked when our redux store updates.
They are responsible for determining and constructing the props that are passed to
presentational component.

* Define `mapStateToProps`.

  ```js
  const mapStateToProps = state => ({
    // piece of state to container subscribes to
  });
  ```

* Import your `selectAllPokemon` selector.
* Use it to pass a `pokemon` prop to the connected presentational component
`PokemonIndex`. `this.props.pokemon` in `PokemonIndex` will return an array of
all the pokemon objects in the app state.
* In the next phase we'll actually define our `PokemonIndex` component in
`frontend/components/pokemon/pokemon_index.jsx`. Assume it already exists, and
import it.
* `connect` `PokemonIndex` and export the returned component. Like so:

  ```js
  export default connect(
    mapStateToProps
  )(PokemonIndex);
  ```

#### `PokemonIndex`

Now let's write the `PokemonIndex` presentational component, which should render
an unordered list of pokemon names next to corresponding images.

* Create a `frontend/components/pokemon/pokemon_index.jsx` file.
* Define and export a *stateless*, *functional* component that renders a `<li>` for each pokemon object in the `this.props.pokemon` array.
  * Display the pokémon's name and a *small* image. Use the given stylesheets.
* Import the container component to `root.jsx`.
* Nest and rendera `<PokemonIndexContainer />` within your `<Root />` component.

**Test your `PokemonIndex` components**: To start, your app should render and empty
of pokemon objects reflecting your app's initial state. Look for webpack and console errors when debugging. Next, amend your doc-ready callback to `dispatch` a `REQUEST_ALL_POKEMON` action. Like so:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const store = configureStore();
  const root = document.getElementById('root');
  ReactDOM.render(<Root store={store}/>, root);

  store.dispatch(requestAllPokemon()); // for testing
});
```

Now you should see your list of pokémon whenever you refresh the page. Go ahead
and remove all other extraneous action creators, constants, and code snippets
used for testing from our entry point if you haven't already. **Show a TA that your pokemon React components render before moving on!**

---

## Phase 4: React Router

Now let's say we want the ability to click on any of the listed pokemon and see
more details about them. In order to maintain a common user interface used
around the web, we will have the URL define what components the user sees. This
is exactly what the powerful `react-router` package is for. To use it, navigate
to `root.jsx` and import the following:

```js
import { Router, Route, hashHistory } from 'react-router';
```

Refer to the [react-router documentation][routes-docs] as a reference.

[routes-docs]: https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/RouteConfiguration.md

### Adding the `Router`

The React-Router `<Router />` component is responsible for listening for changes
to our browser's url. When the url changes, the `Router` determines which
component to render based on which `Route`'s `path` matches the url.

* Wrap the `Router` in your app's `Root` and `Provider`.
* Pass the router `hashHistory` as a `history` prop.

Your `Root` should now look like this:

```js
import { Router, Route, hashHistory } from 'react-router';

const Root = ({ store }) => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <Router history={hashHistory}>
      // routes will go here
    </Router>
  </Provider>
);
```

### Adding a `Route`

Instead of rendering the `PokemonIndexContainer` directly, setup a root
`Route` that will render the component when `path="/"`. Like so:

```js
<Provider store={store}>
  <Router history={hashHistory}>
		<Route path="/" component={PokemonIndexContainer} />
  </Router>
</Provider>
```

**Test that your `PokemonIndex` component still renders at your app's root url**

#### Adding an `onEnter` Hook

The `react-router` package provides us with [`onEnter`][on-enter] hooks which are called
when a route is about to be entered. They are added to routes like so:

```js
<Route path='PATH' component={COMPONENT} onEnter={ON_ENTER_CALLBACK} />
```

This allows us to re-factor our `requestAllPokemon` dispatch, which we're
currently triggering in the doc-ready callback. Let's add an onEnter
hook to our `/` component. This hook will trigger a function whenever we visit
the root url. Thus when the page first loads, we'll trigger an action that
fetches all our pokémon from the database.

In `root.jsx`:
* Import the `requestAllPokemon` action creator.
* Define a function inside of `Root`, called `requestOnEnter`, that dispatches an
invoked `requestAllPokemon`.
* Add an `onEnter` hook with a `requestOnEnter` callback to your root route.
* Remove the dispatch to `requestAllPokemon` from your doc-ready callback.

Your `Root` should now look like this:

```js
const Root = ({ store }) => {
	const requestOnEnter = () => {
		store.dispatch(requestAllPokemon());
	};

	return (
		<Provider store={store}>
			<Router history={History}>
				<Route path="/" component={PokemonIndexContainer} onEnter={requestOnEnter} />
		</Provider>
	);
};
```

**Test that your app still renders a list of all your pokemon!** You've
successfully added a `react-router` `Router` with a root `Route` that renders
your `PokemonIndexContainer` with an `onEnter` hook that fetches all of the
pokemon in your database and populates your app's state. :tada:
