# Redux Piano Project

Live demo available [here][demo]!

[demo]:

## Overview
We'll use React.js and Redux to create our own musical keyboard!

**NB:** Make sure to test as you go. Your understanding will suffer if you code an entire section before figuring out how to make it run. Start small and append.

## Phase 1: Redux Structure

* Create a project directory.
* Run `npm init --yes` to set up your `package.json`.
* Run `npm install --save webpack react react-dom react-redux redux babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react` to set up React and Redux.
* Run `npm install --save jquery`. We'll be using jQuery later.
* Create a `frontend` folder at the root of your project to contain your front-end code.
* Model your `frontend` folder on the diagram below:

```
frontend/
  + actions/
  + components/
  + constants/
  + reducers/
  + store/
  + util/
  + piano.jsx
```

These folders will store our front-end goodies.
* Next, configure your webpack setup in `webpack.config.js` to compile all of your JS into a `bundle.js`.

## Phase 2: Notes!

First, make a `note.js` file inside of your `util` folder. We'll provide the code for this phase. Copy and paste the following into `note.js`

```js
// util/note.js
const ctx = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();

const createOscillator = (freq) => {
  const osc = ctx.createOscillator();
  osc.type = "sine";
  osc.frequency.value = freq;
  osc.detune.value = 0;
  osc.start(ctx.currentTime);
  return osc;
};

const createGainNode = () => {
  const gainNode = ctx.createGain();
  gainNode.gain.value = 0;
  gainNode.connect(ctx.destination);
  return gainNode;
};

const Note = function (freq) {
  this.oscillatorNode = createOscillator(freq);
  this.gainNode = createGainNode();
  this.oscillatorNode.connect(this.gainNode);
};

Note.prototype.start = function () {
  this.gainNode.gain.value = 0.3;
};

Note.prototype.stop = function () {
  this.gainNode.gain.value = 0;
}

module.exports = Note;
```

Test that you can play a note from the console by passing in a sample frequency, like 800.

#### `Tones`

Create a `constants/tones.js` file. From there export a `TONES` constant, a JavaScript object mapping note names to frequencies. Feel free to use [this table][note-frequencies] as a resource!

## Phase 3: Key

#### Action Creators
Let's define the actions that represent what happened.

#### Reducer
Now that we've defined the actions that will send data from your app to the store, let's define the reducers that update the state base on the actions.

#### Store
Let's create a store that holds the state and calls the reducer when an action is dispatched.

Recap, in Redux a store is responsible for:
+ holding your app's state
+ allowing access to state via `getState()`
+ allowing state to be updated via `dispatch(action)`
+ registering listeners via `subscribe(listener)`
+ handling the unregistering of listeners

In `piano.jsx`, import `createStore()` from `redux`. To create the store, call `createStore` and pass it your app's reducer.

### KeyListeners

Create a `util/key_listeners.js` file. This file will hold jQuery listerner for `keyup` and `keydown` events. Install event handlers by calling the `on` methods on `$(document)`. Wrap these two listeners within a single function that will be your entire export.

```js
// util/key_listerners.js
module.exports = () => {
  $(document).on('keydown', (e) => {
    // dispatch a keyAction to add key
  });
  $(document).on('keyup', (e) => {
    // dispatch a keyAction to remove key
  });
}
```

When a user presses a key, the key listener should call your `keyPressed(key)` function from `key_actions.js`, which will change add a key to the state of your application. Likewise, when a user releases a key, the listener should call your `keyReleased(key)` function to remove the key from the state.

There's a helpful property of the `KeyboardEvent` to determine which `key` to pass to your action.

**NB:** Do not create an instance of a `Note` here. The callback function of each jQuery listener should pass the key alone to the action. The state keeps track of which keys are pressed. We'll store `Note` objects as instance variables in our React components.

**NB:** A jQuery `'keydown'` listener fires repeatedly when the user holds down a key, which will repeatedly trigger our `keyPressed` function. Ensure that you call the `keyPressed` function only once per key by only adding the key to the state if it isn't already added!

Make sure that your have your key actions, reducer and listeners working before continuing.

## Phase 4: React Components

### `NoteKey`

Let's write a `NoteKey` React class component. We're calling it `NoteKey` to distinguish it from the keyboard's keys.

This component will be the visual representation of a single note in your piano. It's also the component responsible for whether or not to play a `Note`. The `Piano` component will pass `NoteKey` a single `key` as a prop. After `NoteKey` has mounted, create a new `Note` instance and store it as an instance variable.

Flashback: your `Note` constructor takes a frequency as a parameter, not a string. Use your `Tones` constant to convert the string to the right frequency.

The `NoteKey` component listens to the store. If its `key` is in the state, then the `NoteKey` should `start` its `Note`.

Add a listener in `componentDidMount`. Remember to store the listener as an instance variable so you can remove it in `componentWillUnmount`.

### `Piano`

Let's support more than one `NoteKey` by creating a `Piano` component (`components/piano.jsx`). It will render a `NoteKey` for each of the `TONES`.

Now we can test our setup. When your `Piano` is mounted it should call the method we exported from `util/key_listeners`, thereby adding `keydown` and `keyup` event listeners. In `piano.jsx` use `ReactDOM` to position our `Piano` on the page. Remember to provide an HTML container as the second argument of `ReactDOM.render`. Open your HTML file and press some keys. You should hopefully hear sound!

If you don't here anything, first check for errors in your console and errors in the `webpack`ing. Follow the redux pattern to debug piece by piece. Start at the beginning and debug your way through.

## Phase 5: Style your Piano

Use your css knowledge and style your components so that it looks like a piano.

Bonus:  Using CSS rules and the `state` of your `NoteKey` components, visually update
a `NoteKey` when the user plays its note.
