# A note about some syntax differences

These lectures were recorded prior to the introduction of ES6-style syntax to
React. As a result, you may see a slightly different syntax than in the rest of
the React curriculum materials. Review the 
[component declaration][component-declaration] reading for more discussion of the differences.
