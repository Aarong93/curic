# Links

`<Link>` is one way users can navigate around your application, issuing
an on-click navigation event to a route defined in your router. `<Link>` renders a fully accessible anchor tag with the proper href in
the DOM.

Here's an example.

```js
// app.jsx

class App extends React.components {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>App</h1>
        <ul>
          <li><Link to="/about">About</Link></li> // =>  <li><a href="#/about">About</a></li>
          <li><Link to="/inbox">Inbox</Link></li> // => <li><a href="#/inbox">Inbox</a></li>
        </ul>
        {this.props.children}
      </div>
    )
  }  
}

```

`<Link>` can take a number of different props, including:

* `to`: A route location description that can point to an absolute path, e.g. `/about`
* `onClick(e)`: A custom handler for the click event.
* `activeClassName`: The className a `<Link>` receives when its route is active that
can be used for styling.

A `<Link>` will be active if the current route is either the linked route
or any descendant of the linked route. To have the link be active only on the
exact linked route, use `<IndexLink>` instead.

## `<IndexLink>`

An `<IndexLink>` is like a `<Link>`, except it is only active when the current route
is exactly the linked route. It is equivalent to `<Link>` with the [`onlyActiveOnIndex`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/docs/API.md#onlyactiveonindex) prop set.

See the [React docs](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/IndexRoutes.md) for more information on `<Link>`.
