# Node Package Manager (NPM)

You're likely already somewhat familiar with NPM and how it can be used to
install javascript dependencies called **node modules** for your app (e.g. `npm
install webpack -g`).

This reading will cover the configuration process for automating node module
installation for apps that have several dependencies.

## Generating `package.json` with `npm init`

Much like Ruby's `Gemfile`, NPM can be used with a manifest file that lists all
of an app's dependencies. This file is called `package.json`. While you can
generate write this file by hand, NPM's CLI (command line interface) simplifies
the process a lot.

To intialize an app with NPM, run this in the directory of the app: 

```bash
	npm init --yes
``` 

This creates a `package.json` file using default boilerplate (from the `--yes` flag). It should look something like this: 

```json
{
  "name": "test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

Don't worry about the details above; they won't affect how your app runs, and
you can always adjust them later.

## Installing packages

Once you've generated a `package.json`, you can start installing npm packages such as `react` and `redux` via the command:

```npm install <package>```

This will look up a package by its name and automatically download it into a
folder in your app called `node_modules`, kind of like `gem install <gem>`.
However, it doesn't make any record of the installation, so if someone clones
your app, or if you try to run it on a different computer (say, your production
server), the package will be missing!

Adding the `--save` flag to your `npm install` command will install the package
*and* list it in your `package.json`:

```
npm install --save react redux

```

adds the following to your `package.json`:

```
{
	...
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^15.3.0",
    "redux": "^3.5.2"
  }
}
```

(Note: You can use the `--save-dev` flag instead to specify packages for the development environment only).

Now, anyone who gets a copy of your app can download all your dependencies in
one fell swoop by running the following (with no arguments):

```npm install```


## Add a Webpack Script

Recall that, in Ruby, running `bundle exec some_command` is **not the same** as running `some_command`. In the former, the `Gemfile`-specified version of `some_command` is run, while in the latter, the local version is run. Omitting `bundle exec` when running commands can cause errors if our app isn't compatible with the local version.

To solve this issue with NPM packages, we need to add `"scripts"` for any packages that we intend to call from the command line. Once we've added a script for a package, we can 

```
npm run that_package
```

to ensure that we run the `package.json` specified version.

To create a `webpack` script, add the following attribute to your `package.json`:

```
"scripts": {
  "webpack": "webpack"
},
```

Now, when you run `webpack` in the terminal, the `package.json`-specified
version will run.

Always run `npm run webpack` rather than `webpack` to minimize the chance of
compatibility issues.

# Summary

`npm init --yes`:  create `package.json`
`npm install --save <package>`: install and list a package as a dependency
`npm install`: download all dependencies listed in `package.json`
