# XOR (Exclusive OR)

## Definition

XOR (short for 'exclusive OR') is a [logical operator][log-op], like OR and AND.
XOR means 'Either A or B, but not both'. The 'but not both' clause is what
differentiates it from OR, which means 'Either A or B or both'. In ruby, XOR is
written as `^`.

```ruby

	true ^ false # true
	false ^ true # true

	false ^ false # false
	true ^ true # false

	# Compare the last example against OR: 
	true || true # true

```

## Bit-wise XOR with numbers

When you XOR two numbers, Ruby converts them to binary and compares their
corresponding digits (a.k.a. 'bits') using XOR, where `1` is `true` and `0` is
`false`.

```ruby
(a = 2).to_s(2) # "10"
(b = 6).to_s(2) # "110"

# Note: `to_s(2)` converts a decimal to binary

c = a ^ b

# bit-wise operation
# a = 010
# b = 110
# xor ---
# c = 100

# The end result is converted back to an integer.

c == 4 == "100".to_i(2) # true
```

## Using XOR to hash

Recall the properties of a hashing function:  
	1) **Determinism:** Its output is directly determined by the input data.
	2) **Comprehensiveness:** It uses all the input data.
	3) **Uniformity:** Its possible return values are evenly distributed.
	4) **Continuity:** It returns similar values for similar inputs.

Bit-wise XOR is often used in hashing functions because it promotes high
determinism, comprehensiveness, and uniformity. It also has high continuity, which may need to be offset with other methods where a hashing function needs to have a more unpredictable 'spread' of hashed values.

What separates XOR from other bit-wise operators is uniformity: only
XOR returns `1` and `0` in equal probability, given any two inputs.

```
Truth Table for Bitwise Operations

 a | b | AND | OR  | XOR |
---+---+-----+-----+-----+
 0   0    0     0     0   
 1   0    0     1     1   
 0   1    0     1     1   
 1   1    1     1     0   
``` 

This allows it to produce more uniformly distributed values, distinguishing it
as a desirable hashing method.
