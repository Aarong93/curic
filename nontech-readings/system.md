# System

Bash:
Bash (an acronym for Bourne-again shell) is a unix shell and command language written for the GNU project as a free software replacement for the Bourne (Unix) shell. Bash is a command processor / command line interpreter (CLI) that typically runs in a text window.

Dotfiles:
When Bash starts, it executes the commands in its dot files. These can include `/etc/profile`, `/etc/bash.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login`, `~/.profile`, and `~/.bashrc`. It will also run the commands in `~/.bash_logout` when it exits. These commands can include the creation of aliases for commands (common aliases include `alias gs='git status'`)

Command Line Interpreters:
Computers initially (from the 1960s on) only allowed text-based interactions. The main features of CLIs are filtering a function's output and piping output from a function into another command. This mode of human-computer interaction was first seriously challenged by Apple, with its introduction of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in the 1980s.

GNU:
GNU stands for GNU's Not Unix. It is the software most commonly combined with the Linux kernel. GNU is composed wholly of free software.

Free Software:
Free Software is software distributed under terms that allow users to runt he software for any purpose as well as to study, change, and distribute the software and any adapted versions. "Free software like free speech, not free coffee."

Unix:
Unix is an operating system that was developed by AT&T in the 1970s (as was C). It was rewritten in C in the 1970s; this allows it to be run on many different platforms. The most popular Unix system today is macOS (formerly OSX). Unix systems incorporate several concepts, including plain text data storage, hierarchical file systems, and modular tools that can interact with each other. Unix's master control program is called the kernel.

Linux:
Linux refers to two distinct ideas: one is a Unix-like kernel written by Linus Torvalds with the help of the open source community; the other is the operating system built on that kernel. Around 2% of desktop computers run Linux, but because the Android OS uses the Linux kernel, so there are now billions of devices running Linux.

Kernel:
The kernel is a computer program that has control over everything that occurs in that computer's operating system. It executes programs and decides what memory each process has access to.

Homebrew:
Homebrew is a free and open-source package management system for macOS. It was written in Ruby, and is particularly popular with Ruby on Rails developers. Homebrew can be used to install packages including `git`, `heroku`, and `rbenv`. 

## Text editors:

Stack Overflow lists Visual Studio, Notepad++, Vim, and Sublime Text as the most popular text editors for developers. 

Notepad++ is a free, open source text editor. It is pretty unstyled, but has a lot of features for its price.

Sublime is a text editor. It costs around $70 for a license, but many programmers try to get around paying for it by using a free trial.

Atom, created by GitHub, is a free and open source text editor written in JavaScript (and HTML / CSS). This means that frontend developers can easily customize the look of it.

Vim is a text editor (typically used on the command line) based on the text editor `vi`. It is free and open source software. Its interface is through text commands rather than a user interface.

Vim vs Emacs:
The rivalry between users of Vim and Emacs has become known as the "Editor Wars." People who use Vim think that Emacs is slow, while people who use Emacs think that Vim is inordinately complicated. Vim users dislike Emacs' use of modifier keys (e.g., CTRL).

Visual Studio Code is a free text editor created by Microsoft in 2015.
