# Heredocs

We know how to format SQL code in a `.sql` file, but what if we mix SQL into
our Ruby code? The answer is to use a **heredoc** to write multi-line strings
with ease:

```ruby
query = <<-SQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  posts
JOIN
  comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id
SQL

db.execute(query)
```

This replaces `<<-SQL` with the text on the next line, up to the closing
`SQL`. We could use any string for the start and end of a heredoc; `SQL` is
just the convention when we are embedding SQL code.

A heredoc produces a string just like quotes do, and returns it into the place
where the opening statement is. You can think of the above code as looking
like this:

```ruby
query = "SELECT * FROM posts JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id"

db.execute(query)
```

This works as well:

```ruby
db.execute(<<-SQL, post_id)
SELECT
  *
FROM
  posts
JOIN
  comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id
WHERE
  posts.id = ?
SQL
```

Notice the use of the `?` interpolation mark; the Ruby variable `post_id` will
be inserted into the query at the `?`. Remember that this sanitizes the
variable to help prevent SQL injection attacks.

Passing the input in as a hash will also sanitize it:

```ruby
db.execute(<<-SQL, post_id: post_id)
SELECT
  *
FROM
  posts
JOIN
  comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id
WHERE
  posts.id = :post_id
SQL
```

And while you can interpolate directly into the heredoc (it is just a string,
after all), it leaves your code vulnerable to SQL injection. Don't do it.

The one exception is in the from clause, where you have to interpolate. For
example:

```ruby
query = <<-SQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  #{table_name}
SQL

db.execute(query)
```

Because the table name can come directly from your database without user
interference, this is usually safe to do.
