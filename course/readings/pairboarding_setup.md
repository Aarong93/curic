# Peer Mock Interview Prep

Please follow these instructions to have everything set up before
your first peer mock interview.

## Job Search Folder

1. Create a new folder in your Google Drive titled "Job Search - [your name]".
2. Change the permissions to "can edit" for career-coaches@appacademy.io   
(find these options under [Folder Name] > Share...).
3. Make a new sub-folder inside this Job Search folder titled "Pairboarding".
4. Make a new spreadsheet inside this "Pairboarding" sub-folder and copy [this material][pairboarding-scorecard] into it.

## Study Notes Repo

To keep track of study materials during the job search, you will use a
Study Notes repo. Clone [this skeleton][study-notes].

After doing a mock interview, you will add the questions you asked and answered
to the notes for that topic as part of the homework for the following day.

That's it! Now you're ready to pairboard.
