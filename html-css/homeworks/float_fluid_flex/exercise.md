## CSS Fluid Grid & Flex Layouts Exercise

Use your latest html recipe page with the latest external stylesheet and update the stylesheet accordingly to practice styling more elements with floats and different layout techniques.

1. Instead of making the nav into an inline-block element, use float to put our nav in the top-right.
2. Just for fun, float the logo to the left and then fix the vertical collapse
3. Replace the static px widths of our aside and main content section with a fluid custom_grid.css
4. You may need to give your recipe image a width of 100% so it takes up the figure and does not have its natural static px width. Do this for all images in your cutom reset file.
5. Continue to replace px with your grid system in your review form

Compare your results to [this example](./example.html), [this stylesheet](../../assets/float_fluid_flex.css) and [this grid stylesheet](../../assets/custom_grid.css).

**Challenge:** there is likely a styling problem with our radio button stars. Find it by inspecting the element with the developer tools and then make the correction in our css.
